## Fundamentals of computing

A computer, in its essence, is a complex machine designed to process and manipulate information rapidly. It achieves this by executing a sequence of instructions given to it, and these instructions are conveyed in a language known as a "programming language." To understand how these languages work and how they communicate with computers, we must delve deeper into the intricacies of computer programming.

### How computers process information

Computers have two primary components that collaborate to process information:

1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: The CPU serves as the computational powerhouse of the computer. It is responsible for executing instructions, performing calculations, and managing data. To communicate with the CPU effectively, programmers write instructions in a programming language, which is then translated into a form that the CPU can understand and execute. This intermediary step is critical, as CPUs only comprehend a specific set of binary instructions, composed of 0s and 1s.

1. **Memory**: Memory plays a crucial role in the computer's operation by temporarily storing data and instructions required by the CPU. Two types of memory are particularly significant:

   - **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: This volatile memory provides fast but temporary storage. When you run a program, its instructions and data are loaded into RAM for quick access by the CPU. However, once the computer is turned off or restarted, the data in RAM is erased.

   - **Storage Drives**: These include hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs) and offer long-term storage for data and programs. Unlike RAM, the data stored on storage drives remains intact even when the computer is powered down.

### Programming languages

Programming languages serve as the vital link between human understanding and machine execution. They allow programmers to write code in a format that resembles human language, making it easier to express complex algorithms and ideas. Programming languages consist of a set of rules and syntax that provide a structured way to communicate with the computer. Here's how it works:

- **Writing Code:** Programmers write code using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE). The code is a sequence of instructions, with each instruction serving a specific purpose, like performing calculations, making decisions, or interacting with data.

- **Compilation or Interpretation:** Once the code is written, it undergoes either compilation or interpretation. In compiled languages like C++ or Java, a special program called a compiler translates the entire code into a binary format that the CPU can directly execute. A compiler translates the entire code into machine code before execution. This means that compiled programs tend to be faster but may require a separate compilation step before running.

  In interpreted languages like Python or JavaScript, an interpreter reads the code line by line, translating and executing it in real-time. An interpreter reads and executes code line by line, making it more flexible and suitable for rapid development and debugging.

Ultimately, whether compiled or interpreted, the goal is the same: to translate the human-readable code into a form the computer's CPU can understand and execute efficiently.

Throughout the rest of this program, we will primarily explore the JavaScript programming language, its unique features, and how to write code in it. Understanding the workings of programming languages is a fundamental step in your journey to becoming a proficient coder, as it empowers you to communicate your ideas and solutions effectively to computers.

## Computers in everyday life

Think about your typical day: you might wake up to the sound of an alarm on your smartphone, which is, you guessed it, a computer. You check your email and catch up with friends on social media, both powered by computers. If you enjoy music, you might stream your favorite songs from an app, and yes, those tunes are coming from a computer too.

<details><summary>❗️ Computers can make difficult tasks simpler.</summary>
 Imagine this: You're planning a road trip with friends, and you need to find the best route. You pull out your smartphone, open a navigation app like Google Maps, and voilà! Your computerized co-pilot guides you every step of the way, helping you avoid traffic jams and reach your destination hassle-free.

Imagine planning this kind of trip without the use of a computer. How much longer do you think it'd take? What resources would you need to have access to in order for you to plan the trip as well as a computer could?

</details>

Beyond our personal lives, computers have transformed the world we live in. For example:

- **Automation:** Picture a car factory. Instead of people manually assembling cars, robots, which are essentially specialized computers, do the heavy lifting. This makes car production faster and more efficient. Or, think about self-checkout kiosks at the grocery store. They scan your items, calculate the total cost, and even accept your payment—all thanks to computer programs running behind the scenes.

- **Data Analysis:** Computers are wizards at processing vast amounts of data. Businesses use them to analyze customer preferences, helping stores stock products you're more likely to buy. Ever shopped online and noticed product recommendations that seem eerily spot on? That's because computers are crunching data about your past purchases and the habits of shoppers similar to you.

- **Medicine:** Doctors use computers for diagnosing diseases and planning treatments. Computers help them analyze medical images, research treatments, and keep patient records safe and organized. Imagine you're getting a medical scan, like an MRI. The detailed images it produces are generated and analyzed by powerful computer software, allowing doctors to make accurate diagnoses.

- **Space Exploration:** NASA and other space agencies use supercomputers to simulate space missions, design spacecraft, and analyze data from distant planets. Ever wondered how we can explore distant planets like Mars without sending humans first? It's thanks to rovers, which are essentially computers on wheels. They're remotely controlled from Earth, sending back data and images that scientists study to learn about these far-off worlds.

These examples illustrate how computers have become essential in our lives, making things more convenient, efficient, and even expanding our understanding of the universe. As you delve into the world of coding, you'll discover how you can harness the power of computers to create solutions, solve problems, and make your mark in this digital age.

## The role of coding

Learning to code isn't just about mastering a skill; it's about gaining the power to shape the world around you. Whether on a small or large scale, your code can make a real impact. Coding is like learning a new language, but it's not a language you speak with your mouth; it's one you use to communicate with computers. Just as a writer uses words to tell a story, a coder uses code to instruct a computer.

For example, imagine you want to build a simple website to share your hobbies or showcase your artwork. By learning to code, you can create a beautiful and personalized website that represents your unique style. Your friends and family can visit, and you've just shared a piece of your world with them, all through your code.
